# Chess Woodpecker App

## Description
This app helps chess players improve their pattern recognition skills by solving puzzles repeatedly over a spaced repetition period, utilizing the Woodpecker Method. The app automatically tracks users' progress, eliminating the need for manual tracking and recording of puzzle-solving metrics. It integrates seamlessly with Lichess.com's public API to retrieve puzzles and solutions.

## What I Learned:
- **Chess.js** and **Chessboard.js** integration to render interactive chess puzzles and manage the game state.
- **Lichess.com API** for fetching puzzle data, including puzzle positions and solutions.
- Implemented **spaced repetition** and **puzzle-solving metrics** to automatically track user progress.

## What I Enhanced:
- **Frontend Development** with **JavaScript** to handle the puzzle UI and user interactions.
- Enhanced **Database management** and backend API development with **Go** and **PostgreSQL**.
- **API Integration** with external services (Lichess) to enrich the user experience and data tracking.
